			<li><b>What is this?</b> This is a PGN trainer. Make your PGN game file from an engine (for example stockfish
				or chessly, or chessable, or wherever you want. Upload the PGN and then pgntrainer will choose a path
				through the PGN and quiz you on it. Ideally you would only have move choices for the other side (ie
				black if you are playing white) so that you only have one right answer to choose from. For example,
				if you have a sicilian line, put all of your expected white choices and the only responses you want
				to drill on for black. Send feedback if that's not clear.
